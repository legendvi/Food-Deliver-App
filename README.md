It provides a seamless and interactive user experience, making it ideal for modern web applications.
### Component-Based Architecture:
The app follows a component-based architecture using `Functional Component` and `react hooks` , allowing for `modular` and `reusable` code. Each component represents a specific part of the UI.

## Reflection:
This app was a experimental app that I made using documentation to see how different concepts work and did not have any intentions of deploying this when started.
It is developed only with `react` and highlights reacts primary advantage over other frameworks which is smaller bundle size of react.
